# YourEDU Development Guide

## Environment Setup
- Use 'vercel dev' to run the application locally
- Never attempt to run the development app yourself - the developer will handle this from Terminal
- When using Git, use 'git add .' instead of adding specific files to ensure all changes are captured

## Tech Stack
- Frontend: React.js
- Backend/Database: Supabase
- API Integration: Claude
- Email Services: Resend

## Development Approach
1. When tackling new features, bug fixes, or enhancements:
   - Consider multiple implementation approaches
   - Create a structured plan before writing code
   - Document your thought process
   - Prioritize working solutions over theoretical perfection

## Supabase Integration
- Use Supabase CLI to explore tables and database structure when needed
- Primary data storage includes: profiles, account_profiles, support_messages, auth.users
- For user deletion operations, provide complete SQL for Supabase editor following this template:
  ```sql
  -- First delete any related data in other tables that reference this user
  DELETE FROM profiles WHERE id = '[USER_ID]';
  DELETE FROM account_profiles WHERE id = '[USER_ID]';
  DELETE FROM support_messages WHERE user_id = '[USER_ID]';
  -- Then delete the user from the auth.users table
  DELETE FROM auth.users WHERE id = '[USER_ID]';
